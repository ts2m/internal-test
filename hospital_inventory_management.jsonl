Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of inventory management, the item \"Ok Nation\" has been discontinued and replaced with an improved version \"Ok Nation Pro\" in a more technologically advanced category, requiring inventory record updates.\n- The item **\"Ok Nation\"** was marked for discontinuation but kept in records for reference.\n  - A new improved item, \"Ok Nation Pro\", was created under the \"Transform Bleeding-Edge Technologies\" category with enhanced specifications.\n  - The inventory previously tracking \"Ok Nation\" in the \"Group Department\" was updated to track \"Ok Nation Pro\" instead, maintaining the same quantity and technical parameters.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- Create a new 'items' record with 'item_name' set to \"Ok Nation Pro\", 'specification' set to \"Enhanced version with improved features\", 'unit' set to \"piece\", and 'category_id' set to the ID of the 'categories' record where 'category_name' is \"Transform Bleeding-Edge Technologies\".\n- Delete the 'inventory' record where its 'item_id' corresponds to the 'items' record with 'item_name' \"Ok Nation\" AND its 'department_id' corresponds to the 'departments' record with 'department_name' \"Group Department\".\n- Create a new 'inventory' record, setting the 'item_id' to the ID of the previously created \"Ok Nation Pro\" item, setting the 'department_id' to the ID of the 'departments' record where 'department_name' is \"Group Department\", setting 'quantity' to 22.27, and setting 'technical_parameters' to \"Often add every billion.\\nGarden nation development guy.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of inventory management, the item \"Build Especially\" has been replaced with an improved \"Build Especially Pro\" version, requiring inventory transfers and specification updates across all departments.\n- A new improved item, \"Build Especially Pro\", was created in the same category as the original item, with enhanced specifications.\n  - All inventory quantities (52.55, 44.49, and 16.3 units) were transferred from the original \"Build Especially\" item to the new \"Build Especially Pro\" item across all three departments (\"Inc Department\", \"PLC Department\", and \"LLC Department\").\n  - The specification of the original \"Build Especially\" item was updated to indicate it has been discontinued and replaced by the new Pro version.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- Create a new 'items' record with 'item_name' set to \"Build Especially Pro\", 'specification' set to \"Improved version with enhanced durability\", 'unit' set to \"pack\", and 'category_id' set to the ID of the 'categories' record where 'category_name' is \"Drive Clicks-And-Mortar Info-Mediaries\".\n- For the 'items' record identified by 'item_name' \"Build Especially\", update the 'specification' field to \"DISCONTINUED - Replaced by Build Especially Pro\".\n- Create a new 'inventory' record, setting the 'item_id' to the ID of the previously created \"Build Especially Pro\" item, 'department_id' to the ID of the 'departments' record where 'department_name' is \"Inc Department\", 'quantity' to 52.55, and 'technical_parameters' to \"Pressure girl he operation authority.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of inventory management, the item \"Game Suggest\" has been discontinued and replaced with an improved version called \"Advanced Game System\", with all existing inventory quantities being transferred to the new item.\n- A new improved item, \"Advanced Game System\", was created under the same \"Reinvent End-To-End Paradigms\" category with enhanced specifications.\n  - All inventory quantities from the discontinued item **\"Game Suggest\"** were transferred to the new \"Advanced Game System\" item across all departments.\n  - The original item **\"Game Suggest\"** was marked as discontinued by updating its specification to indicate it has been replaced.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- Create a new 'items' record with 'item_name' set to \"Advanced Game System\", 'specification' set to \"Next generation gaming package with enhanced features\", 'unit' set to \"pack\", and 'category_id' set to the ID of the 'categories' record where 'category_name' is \"Reinvent End-To-End Paradigms\".\n- For the 'inventory' records where 'item_id' corresponds to the 'items' record with 'item_name' \"Game Suggest\":\n  - Create a new 'inventory' record for each department, setting the 'item_id' to the ID of the previously created \"Advanced Game System\" item, copying all other fields ('department_id', 'quantity', 'technical_parameters') from the original inventory record.\n- For the 'items' record identified by 'item_name' \"Game Suggest\", update the 'specification' field to \"DISCONTINUED - Replaced by Advanced Game System\".\n- Delete all 'inventory' records where 'item_id' corresponds to the 'items' record with 'item_name' \"Game Suggest\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"item_id\": 1032,\n            \"item_name\": \"Game Suggest\",\n            \"specification\": \"DISCONTINUED - Replaced by Advanced Game System\",\n            \"unit\": \"pack\",\n            \"category_id\": 1009\n        },\n        {\n            \"item_id\": 10000,\n            \"item_name\": \"Advanced Game System\",\n            \"specification\": \"Next generation gaming package with enhanced features\",\n            \"unit\": \"pack\",\n            \"category_id\": 1009\n        }\n    ],\n    \"inventory\": [\n        {\n            \"inventory_id\": 10000,\n            \"item_id\": 10000,\n            \"department_id\": 1005,\n            \"quantity\": 87.85,\n            \"technical_parameters\": \"Town instead drive deal send paper realize.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant.

Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of inventory management, a new

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of inventory management, the
