Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of subsidy policy management, the standards for the \"Multi-channeled transitional success\" industry were revised to comply with new EU energy directives, introducing differentiated rates based on project scale.\n- The existing subsidy standard for \"Multi-channeled transitional success\" was updated to reflect new regulatory requirements, with its amount increased to \"9520 EUR\" and notes specifying application to \"projects exceeding 500kW\".\n  - A new complementary subsidy standard was established for smaller-scale projects in the same industry, offering \"7120 EUR\" for \"micro-projects under 100kW capacity\".\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by its association with industry \"Multi-channeled transitional success\" AND current 'subsidy_amount' \"8724 EUR\", update 'subsidy_amount' to \"9520 EUR\" and 'notes' to \"Updated per 2024 EU energy directives - applies to projects exceeding 500kW\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record, setting its 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Multi-channeled transitional success\", with 'subsidy_amount' as \"7120 EUR\" and 'notes' as \"Special case for micro-projects under 100kW capacity\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1053,\n            \"industry_id\": 1028,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"9520 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated per 2024 EU energy directives - applies to projects exceeding 500kW\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1028,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"7120 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Special case for micro-projects under 100kW capacity\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e1eeadf8ef434044a7abd1f9b48380ce", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Multi-channeled transitional success\"}}"}}, {"id": "5b5ed43dac644768ad8f35870abe9e53", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"industry_id\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": 1028}, \"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"8724 EUR\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "e1eeadf8ef434044a7abd1f9b48380ce", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1028, \"industry_name\": \"Multi-channeled transitional success\", \"unit\": \"kW\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Western specific respond book customer.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of subsidy program management, the \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\" industry has updated its financial support framework to better reflect current market conditions and added a new premium tier for large-scale projects.\n- The existing subsidy standard offering \"3453 EUR\" was updated to \"4000 EUR\" with revised notes to reflect current market conditions.\n  - A new premium subsidy standard was established for the industry, offering \"15000 EUR\" for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity, with appropriate documentation.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by 'subsidy_amount' \"3453 EUR\" AND 'notes' \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\", update the 'subsidy_amount' to \"4000 EUR\" and 'notes' to \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record with 'subsidy_amount' set to \"15000 EUR\" and 'notes' set to \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\", setting the 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1051,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"4000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"15000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0fe3a4faab7a49b1b5a3cf7a0c1afa1f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\"}}"}}, {"id": "b1f564f1fc0a4231b8b6521983b93cf6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"3453 EUR\"}, \"notes\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "0fe3a4faab7a49b1b5a3cf7a0c1afa1f", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1027, \"industry_name\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\", \"unit\": \"kW\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Drop operation power serve us husband.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of demonstration site management, the \"Love, Novak and Hancock Demonstration Site\" has successfully implemented technological improvements and demonstrated significantly better performance, qualifying it for increased subsidy funding.\n- The **\"Love, Novak and Hancock Demonstration Site\"** underwent a performance re-evaluation, with its score improving from 1.07 to 4.5 after implementing new technologies.\n  - The site's implementation content was updated to reflect the addition of \"advanced IoT monitoring systems and renewable energy solutions\".\n  - Based on the improved performance, the site's subsidy amount was increased from \"42717.2\" to \"51260.64\".\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'demonstration_sites' record identified by 'site_name' \"Love, Novak and Hancock Demonstration Site\", update the 'performance_score' to 4.5, 'implementation_content' to \"Implemented advanced IoT monitoring systems and renewable energy solutions.

These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of industrial subsidy management, the \"Object-based human-resource secured line\" industry maintained its existing subsidy standard while receiving an additional enhanced subsidy option as part of a quarterly policy update to better support this sector.\n- The existing subsidy standard of \"8349 CNY\" for the **\"Object-based human-resource secured line\"** industry was retained for historical reference and continuity.\n  - A new enhanced subsidy standard of \"12000 CNY\" was established for the same industry, reflecting updated Q3 2024 support policies with the note \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\".\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- Maintain the existing 'subsidy_standards' record where 'subsidy_amount' is \"8349 CNY\" for the industry identified by 'industry_name' \"Object-based human-resource secured line\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record for the industry where 'industry_name' is \"Object-based human-resource secured line\", setting 'subsidy_amount' to \"12000 CNY\" and 'notes' to \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1002,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"12000 CNY\",\n            \"notes\": \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c6235a62a7d54149b5bf63130c2f6a24", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Object-based human-resource secured line\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "c6235a62a7d54149b5bf63130c2f6a24", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1002, \"industry_name\": \"Object-based human-resource secured line\", \"unit\": \"kg\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Majority study ability sign detail near phone enter.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of demonstration site management, the \"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\" has completed significant upgrades, resulting in improved performance metrics and requiring additional subsidy funding to support the new technologies.\n- The performance score for **\"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\"** was upgraded from 1.17 to 4.5, reflecting substantial operational improvements.\n  - The implementation content was expanded to include details about newly installed \"solar panel technology and IoT monitoring systems\".\n  - The subsidy amount for the site was increased by 50% (from 23486.06 to 35229.09) to support these technological upgrades.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'demonstration_sites' record identified by 'site_name' \"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\", update the 'performance_score' field to 4.5.\n- For the same record, update the 'implementation_content' field to \"Quality find trip.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of demonstration site management, the \"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\" has completed significant upgrades, resulting in improved performance metrics and requiring additional subsidy funding to support the new technologies.\n- The performance score for **\"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\"** was upgraded from 1.17 to 4.5, reflecting substantial operational improvements.\n  - The implementation content was expanded to include details about newly installed \"solar panel technology and IoT monitoring systems\".\n  - The subsidy amount for the site was increased by 50% (from 23486.06 to 35229.09) to support these technological upgrades.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'demonstration_sites' record identified by 'site_name' \"Clark, Pittman and Bailey Demonstration Site\", update the 'performance_score' field to 4.5.\n- For the same record, update the 'implementation_content' field to \"Quality find trip.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of subsidy policy management, the \"Down-sized incremental implementation\" industry's financial support framework was revised to comply with new 2024 regulations, resulting in both an adjustment to an existing standard and the introduction of a new supplemental standard.\n- The existing subsidy standard for the **\"Down-sized incremental implementation\"** industry was updated from \"365 USD\" to \"500 USD\", with the notes field revised to indicate compliance with \"2024 regulatory guidelines\".\n  - A new supplemental subsidy standard was established for the same industry, offering \"200 EUR\" specifically for export-focused projects within the **\"Down-sized incremental implementation\"** sector.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by its association with the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Down-sized incremental implementation\" AND 'subsidy_amount' is \"365 USD\", update the 'subsidy_amount' field to \"500 USD\" and the 'notes' field to \"Updated per 2024 regulatory guidelines\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record, setting the 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Down-sized incremental implementation\", with 'subsidy_amount' set to \"200 EUR\" and 'notes' set to \"Supplemental standard for export-focused projects\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1041,\n            \"industry_id\": 1021,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"500 USD\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated per 2024 regulatory guidelines\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1021,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"200 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Supplemental standard for export-focused projects\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a05b974344504c9baca8ac38ece54ece", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Down-sized incremental implementation\"}}"}}, {"id": "b02cb854c61a4f66b9a5ddbe64369487", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"industry_id\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": 1021}, \"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"365 USD\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "a05b974344504c9baca8ac38ece54ece", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1021, \"industry_name\": \"Down-sized incremental implementation\", \"unit\": \"liter\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Late service wife democratic.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of subsidy management, the \"Proactive empowering parallelism\" industry's subsidy standards were updated to comply with new 2024 Q3 regulations, including both an adjustment to the existing USD standard and the addition of a new EUR-denominated standard.\n- The existing USD subsidy standard for the **\"Proactive empowering parallelism\"** industry was updated from \"8176 USD\" to \"9200 USD\", with notes reflecting the \"2024 Q3 regulatory requirements\" change.\n  - A new EUR-denominated subsidy standard was established for the same industry, with an amount of \"8500 EUR\" and notes indicating it as an \"Additional EU-compliant standard\".\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by its 'standard_id' 1018, update the 'subsidy_amount' field to \"9200 USD\" and update the 'notes' field to \"Updated per 2024 Q3 regulatory requirements\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record with 'industry_id' set to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Proactive empowering parallelism\", setting 'subsidy_amount' to \"8500 EUR\" and 'notes' to \"Additional EU-compliant standard\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1018,\n            \"industry_id\": 1010,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"9200 USD\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated per 2024 Q3 regulatory requirements\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1010,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"8500 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Additional EU-compliant standard\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ee1b9994b16244dfa7e32feb430c22fc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"standard_id\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": 1018}}"}}, {"id": "8f0b1b56f50a42f180b429fb3a02af1b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Proactive empowering parallelism\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "ee1b9994b16244dfa7e32feb430c22fc", "name": "query_subsidy_standards", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"standard_id\": 1018, \"industry_id\": 1010, \"subsidy_amount\": \"8176 USD\", \"notes\": \"Step remember space certain child quickly.\"}]}"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "8f0b1b56f50a42f180b429fb3a02af1b", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1010, \"industry_name\": \"Proactive empowering parallelism\", \"unit\": \"kg\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Minute author my positive plant save act ground.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by 'subsidy_amount' \"3453 EUR\" AND 'notes' \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\", update the 'subsidy_amount' to \"4000 EUR\" and 'notes' to \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record with 'subsidy_amount' set to \"15000 EUR\" and 'notes' set to \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\", setting the 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1051,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"4000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"15000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "bbd1c57768f54010a4d17480a6c9fd25", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"3453 EUR\"}, \"notes\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\"}}"}}, {"id": "1c0711fcbfde47f7a430570fab67e0ad", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "bbd1c57768f54010a4d17480a6c9fd25", "name": "query_subsidy_standards", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": []}"}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "1c0711fcbfde47f7a430570fab67e0ad", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1027, \"industry_name\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\", \"unit\": \"kW\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Drop operation power serve us husband.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of subsidy program management, the \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\" industry has updated its financial support framework to better reflect current market conditions and added a new premium tier for large-scale projects.\n- The existing subsidy standard offering \"3453 EUR\" was updated to \"4000 EUR\" with revised notes to reflect current market conditions.\n  - A new premium subsidy standard was established for the industry, offering \"15000 EUR\" for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity, with appropriate documentation.\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by 'subsidy_amount' \"3453 EUR\" AND 'notes' \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\", update the 'subsidy_amount' to \"4000 EUR\" and 'notes' to \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record with 'subsidy_amount' set to \"15000 EUR\" and 'notes' set to \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\", setting the 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1051,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"4000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated standard reflecting current market conditions\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1027,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"15000 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Premium subsidy for large-scale projects exceeding 1MW capacity\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ea509d50ba6c4796bff8b44aa2dd08fb", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\"}}"}}, {"id": "65c19e29c57b44d7ac404567c1faf233", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"3453 EUR\"}, \"notes\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Mission buy staff there nearly generation value\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "ea509d50ba6c4796bff8b44aa2dd08fb", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1027, \"industry_name\": \"Front-line explicit knowledgebase\", \"unit\": \"kW\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Drop operation power serve us husband.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<BUSINESS_LOGIC>\nFrom the perspective of industrial subsidy management, the \"Object-based human-resource secured line\" industry maintained its existing subsidy standard while receiving an additional enhanced subsidy option as part of a quarterly policy update to better support this sector.\n- The existing subsidy standard of \"8349 CNY\" for the **\"Object-based human-resource secured line\"** industry was retained for historical reference and continuity.\n  - A new enhanced subsidy standard of \"12000 CNY\" was established for the same industry, reflecting updated Q3 2024 support policies with the note \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\".\n</BUSINESS_LOGIC>\n\n<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- Maintain the existing 'subsidy_standards' record where 'subsidy_amount' is \"8349 CNY\" for the industry identified by 'industry_name' \"Object-based human-resource secured line\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record for the industry where 'industry_name' is \"Object-based human-resource secured line\", setting 'subsidy_amount' to \"12000 CNY\" and 'notes' to \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1002,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"12000 CNY\",\n            \"notes\": \"Enhanced subsidy for Q3 2024 policy update\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "4e550ee4f4664cdd84dfa231e12ba8f9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Object-based human-resource secured line\"}}"}}, {"id": "8da878ff6b7c4d519fa8d59c715665ae", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"industry_id\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": 1002}, \"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"8349 CNY\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "4e550ee4f4664cdd84dfa231e12ba8f9", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1002, \"industry_name\": \"Object-based human-resource secured line\", \"unit\": \"kg\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Majority study ability sign detail near phone enter.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name.

The value must be a string. No specific format is enforced.\n        seq: Optional filter for the sequence value.\n            e.g., {'op': '>', 'value': 100}. The value must be an integer.\n        order_by: Optional list of columns to sort by, e.g., [\"name ASC\", \"seq DESC\"].\n        limit: Optional integer to limit the number of results. Must be >= 0.\n        offset: Optional integer to offset the results for pagination. Must be >= 0.\n        Supported operators are `'='`, `'<'`, `'>'`, `'<='`, `'>='`, `'<>'`, `'LIKE'`, `'NOT LIKE'`, `'IN'`, and `'NOT IN'`.\n\n    Returns:\n        Dict[str, Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]]: A dictionary indicating the outcome.\n        - On success: {'status': 'success', 'content': [list_of_records]}\n          The `content` is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a record\n          from the sqlite_sequence table.

Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, you must fully leverage your available tools to gather necessary information *before* executing any actions, in accordance with your Prime Directive.\n\n**Operational Context:**\n\nBefore determining your next action, you **must** first observe and synthesize information from three primary sources:\n1.  **`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`**: A series of natural language descriptions detailing common business operations and user stories. These narratives describe the real-world tasks.\n2.  **`<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`**: The primary objective and a description of the user's goal.\n3.  **`<TASK_PAYLOAD>`**: Structured data containing the specific parameters required to execute the actions described in the task. **Crucially, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` is NOT a representation of the current system state; it is the input for your actions.**\n4.  **`History Messages`**: The record of previous interactions and tool calls in the current session.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1.  **Query First, Act Second (The Unbreakable Rule):** To reiterate your Prime Directive: Before performing **any** action that creates, updates, or deletes data (using the parameters from `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`), you **MUST** first use your query tools to verify the current, real-time state of the system. This step is your most critical safeguard against errors, data corruption, and acting on outdated information.\n\n2.  **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **must** use information exactly as it is provided in the `<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>` or `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`. **Do not alter, reformat, or reinterpret the data.** For example, if the payload provides a date as `2025-03-01`, you must use `2025-03-01` in your tool parameters, not `1st Mar., 2025`.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct Complex Requests:** Break down multi-step user requests into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks. For each sub-task, determine if you need to query for information before acting, guided by the principles above.\n\n4.  **Prioritize System Information Gathering:** When you receive a request, your first step is to identify what information you need to complete it successfully. Use your **query tools** to gather this data proactively from the system.\n\n5.  **Verify All Entities:** Never assume an entity (e.g., a user, a file, a project) described in the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` already exists. Always query to confirm its existence and retrieve its unique identifier before attempting to link it to another entity or modify it.\n\n6.  **Create Missing Entities and Proceed**: If a query confirms that an entity from the `<TASK_PAYLOAD>` does not exist, you **must** first call the appropriate tool to create that entity. Once created, you can proceed with the remaining parts of the original request.\n\n**Core Mandate: Autonomous Execution**\n\n*   **No User Dialogue:** You **must not** solicit additional information, clarifications, or operational confirmations from the user. Assume all necessary information has been provided in the initial context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`, `History Messages`).\n*   **Infer and Proceed:** In cases of ambiguity or missing parameters, you must infer the most logical values, apply sensible defaults, or deduce the correct course of action from the context to ensure task completion without user intervention.\n*   **Mandatory Execution:** Upon successful internal verification, **you are to proceed with the execution of the task immediately.** The action is mandated and does not require a final user approval step.\n\n**Problem Solving and Progression:**\n\n*   **Never Default to Refusal Without Reasoning:** If you encounter a request that appears unsupported or constrained, **do not default to refusal**. Instead, analyze the request, internally determine the most logical path forward, and execute it. Your function is to complete the task through autonomous reasoning and reformulation.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nYour fundamental workflow is immutable and starts with a query: **Observe Context (`<BUSINESS_LOGIC>`, `<TASK_DESCRIPTION>`, `<TASK_PAYLOAD>`) → QUERY (Mandatory) → Verify → EXECUTE**. Be methodical and diligent. By grounding every action in **queried and verified**, up-to-date information and maintaining strict data fidelity, you will function as a reliable and highly effective assistant, acting decisively and autonomously.\n", "interact_llm_system_prompt": "### **Role and Objective**\n\nYou are an autonomous and highly capable AI assistant. Your primary objective is to fulfill user requests accurately, efficiently, and autonomously. You will act decisively on verified information, but you **will seek confirmation for ambiguous interpretations or irreversible actions.**\n\n### **Core Directive: QUERY FIRST, ACT SECOND**\n\nThis is your immutable, non-negotiable rule. Before executing **ANY** action that creates, modifies, or deletes data (e.g., `create_user`, `update_file`, `delete_record`), you **MUST** first use the appropriate query tools (e.g., `get_user`, `find_file`) to retrieve the current, real-time state of the system. This directive prevents errors, ensures you are working with up-to-date information, and is the foundation of all your operations.\n\n### **Operational Workflow**\n\nFollow this sequential workflow for every user request.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct and Analyze**\n*   Break down the user's request into discrete, logical sub-tasks.\n*   For each sub-task, identify the necessary entities (e.g., users, files, projects) and the information required for completion.\n\n**Step 2: Query and Verify State**\n*   Proactively use your query tools to gather all required information identified in Step 1.\n*   Crucially, verify the existence and **current state** of **every entity** mentioned in the request. Never assume an entity exists. Always retrieve its unique identifier.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve, Clarify, or Inform**\nThis step determines your path forward based on the results of your query.\n\n*   **Case A: Entity Does Not Exist (Clear Prerequisite)**\n    *   If you have all the necessary information from the user's request to create a missing entity:\n        1.  **CREATE** the missing entity first.\n        2.  **PROCEED** with the original sub-task using the newly created entity.\n\n*   **Case B: Ambiguous or Insufficient Information**\n    *   If the user's request is ambiguous, or you lack critical information needed for an action (e.g., \"Add the new guy to the project\"):\n        1.  **ASK** the user for clarification. Do not invent data or make unsafe assumptions.\n\n*   **Case C: State Mismatch or Redundant Request**\n    *   If an entity exists but the requested action is redundant (e.g., asking to set a status that is already set) or invalid due to its current state:\n        1.  **INFORM** the user of the current state (e.g., \"User 'john.doe' is already a member of this project.\" or \"Ticket #541 is already marked 'In Progress'.\").\n        2.  **STOP** execution of that sub-task and await further instruction.\n\n**Step 4: Execute with Safeguards**\n*   Once all information is verified, all prerequisite entities are confirmed to exist (or have been created), and all ambiguities are resolved, proceed as follows:\n\n    *   **For Non-Destructive Actions** (e.g., creating, adding, updating):\n        1.  **Execute the action(s) immediately and decisively.**\n    *   **For Potentially Destructive Actions** (e.g., deleting, removing, overwriting):\n        1.  **State your intended action** and its consequences clearly to the user (e.g., \"I am about to permanently delete the user 'jane.doe' and all their associated data.\").\n        2.  **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding.\n        3.  **EXECUTE** only after receiving that confirmation.\n\n### **Guiding Principles**\n\nThese principles apply throughout the entire workflow.\n\n*   **Data Fidelity:** When calling tools, you **MUST** use data exactly as it is provided in the context or returned by a previous tool call. Do not reformat or reinterpret values.\n*   **Prioritize User Intent:** Your goal is to solve problems, but not by making risky assumptions. If a request is blocked, favor clarifying the user's intent over autonomously taking a multi-step action that might be incorrect.\n    *   **Good Behavior:** \"User 'Jane Doe' is not a member of the 'Q4 Campaign' project. Should I add her first and then grant her admin rights?\"\n    *   **Bad Behavior:** (Silently adds Jane to the project and then promotes her, risking incorrect permissions if the user made a typo).\n\n### **Summary of Your Core Logic**\n\nYour fundamental process is: **Observe → Deconstruct → Query → Verify State → Resolve (Create, Clarify, or Inform) → Execute (with Confirmation for Destructive Actions).** By grounding every action in queried, real-time data and ensuring user intent is respected, you will function as a reliable and truly capable autonomous agent.\n", "interact_user_system_prompt": "## Role: User Simulator\n\nYou are a User Simulator. Your role is to interact with an AI agent by realistically role-playing a user based on the provided inputs. Your primary function is to test the agent's ability to guide a conversation, gather information effectively, and handle a methodical, step-by-step interaction.\n\n## 1. Simulation Inputs\n\nYour simulation is defined by three key inputs you will be given:\n\n1.  **`<USER_STORY>`**: The high-level narrative context explaining the **'why'** behind your goal. Use this for understanding your motivation but do not quote it directly.\n2.  **`<USER_GOAL>`**: A concise, single-sentence description of your immediate objective (the **'what'**). You will paraphrase this to start the conversation.\n3.  **`<TASK_DATA>`**: A structured data object (e.g., JSON) containing all the information you, as the user, possess.\n    *   This is your **'source of truth'**. All information you provide must come from this data.\n    *   It may include personal details (e.g., name, email), which you only provide if the agent explicitly asks for them.\n    *   **Crucially, this is NOT the system's current state; it is simply the information you have available to give.**\n\n## 2. Your Persona: The Patient & Methodical User\n\nYou will adopt the following persona throughout the interaction:\n\n*   **Cooperative but Concise**: You are helpful and will answer all questions, but you do not offer unsolicited information or engage in small talk.\n*   **Extremely Patient**: You are never frustrated or rushed. If the agent asks for the same information multiple times, you provide it again calmly. If the agent needs to clarify details or asks for confirmation (e.g., \"So that's 'John Doe', correct?\"), you respond and patiently wait for its next directive.\n*   **Follows Instructions Literally**: You follow the agent's lead precisely. You do not anticipate its needs or try to \"help\" by providing information before it is requested.\n\n## 3. Rules of Engagement\n\n### 3.1 Initiating the Conversation\n*   Paraphrase the `<USER_GOAL>` in a natural, single sentence to begin.\n*   **Do not** volunteer any other information from `<TASK_DATA>` in your opening message.\n\n### 3.2 Conversational Flow\n*   **Be Reactive, Not Proactive**: After your opening, **only** provide information when the agent explicitly asks for it. Let the agent lead the conversation.\n*   **One Topic at a Time (Crucial Rule)**: If the agent asks for multiple, distinct pieces of information at once (e.g., \"Can you give me the award details, the participant's name, and the institution's info?\"), you **must respond with information for only the *first* topic requested.**\n    *   *Example Response*: `Okay, for the award, the name is \"Platinum Innovation Prize\", the level is \"Platinum\", and the category is \"Technology\".`\n    *   Then, **stop and wait** for the agent to ask for the next piece of information. This rule is designed to test the agent's ability to handle multi-part questions in a structured way.\n*   **Provide Complete Answers (for a single topic)**: When you answer a question about a topic, provide all the relevant details for that single topic from `<TASK_DATA>`. For example, if asked for an \"address,\" provide the full street, city, and zip code.\n*   **Handle Missing Information**: If the agent asks for information not present in your `<TASK_DATA>`, state that you do not have it (e.g., `I don't have that information.`).\n\n### 3.3 Data Formatting\n*   **Use Quotes for Specific Values**: Any specific data value or identifier from `<TASK_DATA>` **must be enclosed in double quotes (\"\")**.\n*   **Ensure Exact Matches**: The value inside the quotes must be an *exact, character-for-character match* to the source data.\n    *   *Correct*: `\"2024-10-28\"`\n    *   *Incorrect*: `\"October 28th, 2024\"`\n*   **Clarify Ambiguity**: When a value could be ambiguous (e.g., the word \"Active\"), provide context.\n    *   *Example*: `Yes, my account status is \"Active\"`.\n\n## 4. Terminating the Simulation (`###STOP###`)\n\nTo end the simulation, you must use the termination command `###STOP###`. Generate this command **if and only if all three** of the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Information Provided**: You have answered all of the agent's questions, providing all the information it requested from `<TASK_DATA>` that is relevant to the `<USER_GOAL>`.\n\n2.  **Task Definitively Confirmed by Agent**: The agent has **explicitly and definitively** confirmed the task is complete (e.g., \"Your booking is confirmed,\" \"I have successfully scheduled the meeting for you\") **AND** has provided a final summary of the key details.\n    *   An intermediate clarification (e.g., `Okay, I have your name as \"John Doe\", is that correct?`) or a generic closing (e.g., `Is there anything else?`) is **NOT** a final confirmation. **Do not stop.** You must wait for a concluding statement that declares the task finished.\n\n3.  **Verification of Summary**: You have verified the agent's final summary against your `<TASK_DATA>`, and it is correct according to the following logic:\n    *   **Exact Match for User Data**: All descriptive details you provided (e.g., names, dates, addresses, options like `\"Standard\"` shipping) must be an exact match in the agent's summary.\n    *   **Ignore System-Generated IDs**: You **must ignore and accept** any new system-generated identifiers in the agent's summary (e.g., a `confirmation_id`, `ticket_number`, or `booking_ref`). These are not expected to match anything in your `<TASK_DATA>`.\n\n### **5. Required Output Format**\n\nYou **must** structure every response using the following tags.\n\n<THINK>\nPlace your internal reasoning here. Detail your thought process, explain which rule you are following, and note your current state in the simulation. This section is for analysis and is not sent to the AI agent.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nPlace the user's actual response here. This is the only text the AI agent will see. If all termination conditions are met, this tag will contain only \"###STOP###\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Standard Response:**\n<THINK>\nThe agent has asked for my full name and my date of birth. According to the \"One Topic at a Time\" rule, I must only provide the first piece of information: the full name. I will wait for the agent to ask for the date of birth separately.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\nMy full name is \"Jane Emily Doe\".\n</QUERY>\n\n**Example of a Termination Response:**\n\n<THINK>\nThe agent has confirmed the cancellation and provided a final summary. I have verified that all details in the summary match my TASK_DATA. The three conditions for termination have been met.\n</THINK>\n<QUERY>\n###STOP###\n</QUERY>\n\nNow, based on the entire conversation history, please act STRICTLY as the human user and generate the next appropriate response...\n", "tool_system_prompt": null, "react_trajectory": {"llm_messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n- For the 'subsidy_standards' record identified by its association with the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Down-sized incremental implementation\" AND 'subsidy_amount' is \"365 USD\", update the 'subsidy_amount' field to \"500 USD\" and the 'notes' field to \"Updated per 2024 regulatory guidelines\".\n- Create a new 'subsidy_standards' record, setting the 'industry_id' to the ID of the 'industries' record where 'industry_name' is \"Down-sized incremental implementation\", with 'subsidy_amount' set to \"200 EUR\" and 'notes' set to \"Supplemental standard for export-focused projects\".\n</TASK_DESCRIPTION>\n\n<TASK_PAYLOAD>\n{\n    \"subsidy_standards\": [\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 1041,\n            \"industry_id\": 1021,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"500 USD\",\n            \"notes\": \"Updated per 2024 regulatory guidelines\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"standard_id\": 10000,\n            \"industry_id\": 1021,\n            \"subsidy_amount\": \"200 EUR\",\n            \"notes\": \"Supplemental standard for export-focused projects\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</TASK_PAYLOAD>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "8362c3de80214c18b3f47755ee1a8e66", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_industries", "arguments": "{\"industry_name\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"Down-sized incremental implementation\"}}"}}, {"id": "b6f73b781fa9440f944fbdf5ffeedcf7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "query_subsidy_standards", "arguments": "{\"industry_id\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": 1021}, \"subsidy_amount\": {\"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"365 USD\"}}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "8362c3de80214c18b3f47755ee1a8e66", "name": "query_industries", "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": [{\"industry_id\": 1021, \"industry_name\": \"Down-sized incremental implementation\", \"unit\": \"liter\", \"subsidy_requirement\": \"Late service wife democratic.
